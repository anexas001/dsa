Recursion in computer science is a technique where the solution to the problem depends
on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

There are two approaches
1. Top down
2. Down to Top

The case for which we know the answer is called base case.
By setting this base case we can use recusrion to find answer of other values.
Recusrsion uses call stack approach.
